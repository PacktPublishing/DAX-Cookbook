## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
R05_summarizedTable = SUMMARIZE(
 'R05_Table',                             // This is the table to summarize
 [Month],                                 // This is the column by which we want to group values
 [Weekday],                               // This is a second column by which we want to group values
 "# of Days",                             // Create a column called "# of Days"
 COUNTROWS('R05_Table'),                  // Return the count of rows for "# of Days"
 "First Date",                            // Create a second column called "First Date"
